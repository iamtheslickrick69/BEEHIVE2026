## New to Equipment Rental? You're in the Right Place.

Renting professional equipment for the first time can feel intimidating. Big machines, unfamiliar terms, deposits, contracts—it's a lot if you've never done it before.

Here's the truth: **it's easier than you think.**

At BeeHive Rental & Sales, we've been helping first-time renters in Southern Utah since 1994. Homeowners tackling their first landscaping project. DIYers pouring their first concrete slab. Property owners clearing land for the first time.

This guide walks you through everything—what to expect, how rentals work, and how to choose the right equipment for your project.

## How Equipment Rental Works (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Know Your Project

Before you call or visit, have a clear idea of what you're trying to accomplish:

- **What are you doing?** (Digging a trench, tilling a garden, breaking concrete, etc.)
- **How big is the area?** (Square footage, depth, length)
- **What's the terrain like?** (Flat yard, rocky soil, tight space near a fence)
- **How long will it take?** (A few hours, a full day, a weekend)

Don't worry if you're unsure about the equipment—that's what BeeHive's staff is for. But knowing your project helps them recommend the right machine.

### Step 2: Get a Recommendation

Call BeeHive at **435-628-6663** or stop by **1175 Highland Drive in St. George**. Tell them what you're working on. They'll recommend:

- The right equipment for the job
- The size/model that fits your space and skill level
- Any accessories or attachments you might need
- Estimated rental duration

**Pro Tip:** If you're unsure, ask if you can see the equipment before committing. BeeHive's staff will walk you through how it works.

### Step 3: Provide a Deposit

A deposit is required before any equipment leaves the yard. You have three options:

| Deposit Option | How It Works |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Open Check** | Leave a check that's only cashed if there's damage or non-return |
| **Credit Card Hold** | Authorize a temporary hold on your card |
| **Cash Deposit** | Pay 2.5x the rental amount upfront (refunded on return) |

This protects both you and BeeHive. It's standard practice at any reputable rental yard.

### Step 4: Sign the Rental Contract

Before loading equipment, you'll sign a rental agreement covering:

- Equipment condition at pickup
- Rental duration and charges
- Your responsibilities (fuel, cleaning, safe operation)
- Return expectations

Read it. It's straightforward, and the staff will answer any questions.

### Step 5: Get a Quick Tutorial

First time using a skid steer? Never operated a power trowel? **Ask for a walkthrough.** BeeHive's team will show you:

- How to start and stop the machine
- Basic controls and safety features
- What to watch out for
- How to load/unload from a trailer (if applicable)

Don't be shy—this is normal. Even experienced contractors ask questions about unfamiliar equipment.

### Step 6: Use the Equipment

Take it to your job site and get to work. A few things to keep in mind:

- **Track your time.** Rental charges are based on when equipment leaves and returns—not just when you're using it.
- **Don't push beyond your skill level.** If something feels wrong, stop and call BeeHive.
- **Check fluid levels** on longer rentals (oil, hydraulic fluid, coolant).

### Step 7: Return It Clean and Fueled

When you're done:

- **Return with a full tank of fuel** (or pay $7/gallon)
- **Clean off excessive dirt and mud** (or pay a cleaning fee)
- **Return on time** to avoid additional charges

The rental contract stays open until an employee confirms the return and checks the equipment. Make sure you close out properly.

## Understanding Rental Periods and Charges

This is where first-timers often get confused. Here's how it actually works:

### Half-Day Rental
- **Duration:** 4 hours from when equipment leaves the yard
- **Meter limit:** Varies by equipment
- **If you go over:** Additional charges apply

### Full-Day Rental
- **Duration:** 24 hours
- **Meter limit:** 8 hours of actual use
- **If you exceed 8 hours on the meter:** Additional charges apply

### Weekend Rental
- **Pick up:** Saturday
- **Return:** Monday before 8:00 AM
- **Charge:** 1 day (if 8 hours or less on meter)

### Key Point: Time vs. Use

Rental time = clock time (when it leaves to when it returns)
Meter time = actual operating hours

You're charged for both. A machine sitting overnight still counts toward your 24-hour rental period, even if the meter doesn't move.

**Example:** You rent a mini excavator Saturday morning at 8 AM. You dig for 3 hours, then stop for the day. Sunday you dig for another 4 hours. You return it Monday at 7:30 AM.

- Clock time: Saturday 8 AM to Monday 7:30 AM (weekend rate = 1 day)
- Meter time: 7 hours (under the 8-hour limit)
- **You pay for 1 day.** ✓

## What Equipment Can Beginners Actually Use?

Some equipment is beginner-friendly. Some requires experience. Here's an honest breakdown:

### Beginner-Friendly (Little to No Experience Needed)

| Equipment | Difficulty | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Aerator** | Easy | Walk-behind, intuitive operation |
| **Dethatcher / Power Rake** | Easy | Similar to a lawn mower |
| **Rototiller (front-tine)** | Easy | Good for small garden beds |
| **Pressure Washer** | Easy | Point and spray |
| **Generator** | Easy | Start it, plug in, done |
| **Floor Sander (orbital)** | Easy-Medium | Takes practice for even results |
| **Tile Saw** | Easy-Medium | Slow and steady wins |
| **Sod Cutter** | Medium | Requires some physical effort |
| **Jumping Jack Compactor** | Medium | Takes getting used to the bounce |

### Intermediate (Some Practice or Instruction Recommended)

| Equipment | Difficulty | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Rototiller (rear-tine)** | Medium | More powerful, can pull you forward |
| **Concrete Mixer** | Medium | Loading/unloading takes technique |
| **Power Trowel** | Medium | Finishing concrete is a skill |
| **Mini Excavator (E10, E20)** | Medium | Controls are learnable; start slow |
| **Skid Steer (small)** | Medium-Hard | Dual joystick control takes practice |
| **Trencher** | Medium | Keep it straight, let the machine work |

### Advanced (Prior Experience Strongly Recommended)

| Equipment | Difficulty | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Large Excavator (E50, E88, Cat 308)** | Hard | Significant machine, real consequences |
| **Skid Steer (large, S250)** | Hard | 2,500 lb lift capacity—know what you're doing |
| **Concrete Saw (walk-behind)** | Hard | Blade control and depth matter |
| **Jack Hammer (90 lb)** | Hard | Physically demanding, vibration exposure |

**BeeHive's Advice:** If you're unsure, start with the smaller version. A Bobcat E10 teaches you excavator controls without the stakes of an E50. You can always upgrade next time.

## Common First-Timer Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Renting Too Big
**The Problem:** You rent a full-size skid steer for a backyard job and can't maneuver it through the gate.
**The Fix:** Measure your access points. Tell BeeHive your space constraints. They'll recommend equipment that fits.

### Mistake #2: Underestimating Time
**The Problem:** You rent for a half-day, but the job takes 6 hours. Now you're paying for a full day anyway.
**The Fix:** Add buffer time. If you think it'll take 3 hours, rent for 4. If you think a full day, consider overnight.

### Mistake #3: Returning It Dirty
**The Problem:** You return a mud-caked excavator and get charged a $75 cleaning fee.
**The Fix:** Hose it down before returning. "Reasonably clean" means no caked-on dirt or debris.

### Mistake #4: Forgetting to Refuel
**The Problem:** You return the generator with a quarter tank and get charged $7/gallon to fill it.
**The Fix:** Fill up on the way back. It takes 5 minutes and saves real money.

### Mistake #5: Not Asking Questions
**The Problem:** You're embarrassed to ask how the controls work, so you figure it out on-site and waste 2 hours.
**The Fix:** Ask at pickup. BeeHive's staff does walkthroughs all day. It's literally their job.

## What to Bring When You Pick Up Equipment

### Required
- **Valid driver's license** (for ID and contract)
- **Deposit method** (check, credit card, or cash)
- **Appropriate vehicle** (if you're hauling it yourself)

### Trailer Requirements
| Trailer Size | Minimum Tow Vehicle |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Under 10,000 lbs | Half-ton truck (F-150, Silverado 1500) |
| 10,000 lbs or more | ¾-ton truck (F-250, Silverado 2500) or larger |

**Note:** BeeHive offers delivery if you don't have a truck/trailer. Ask about delivery rates to your job site.

### Helpful to Bring
- **Photos of your job site** (helps staff recommend equipment)
- **Measurements** (gate width, trench depth, area size)
- **Questions written down** (so you don't forget)

### Do I need experience to rent equipment?
No. Many of BeeHive's customers are first-time renters. Staff will recommend beginner-friendly equipment and show you how to operate it before you leave.
