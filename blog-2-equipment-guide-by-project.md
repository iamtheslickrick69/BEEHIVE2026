## Frequently Asked Questions

### What equipment do I need to pour a concrete patio?
You'll need a concrete mixer (9 cu. ft.), concrete buggy for transport, vibrator for air removal, bull float and fresno for finishing, and a power trowel for final smoothing. For cutting control joints, use a Husqvarna Soff-Cut 150.

### What's the best excavator for residential trenching?
The Bobcat E20 or E26. Both have zero tail swing, so you can rotate fully without hitting fences or buildings. The E20 digs to 8.5 feet; the E26 adds blade float for easier backfilling.

### What do I need to remove old tile flooring?
Use the Makinex Jackhammer Trolley with a 5" chisel bit for fast removal. For stubborn tile beds, add the Bosch 20 lb Roto Hammer. Finish with an EDCO floor grinder to smooth the concrete.

### How do I compact a trench after backfilling?
For narrow trenches, use a MultiQuip MTX60HD or MTX70HD jumping jack. For longer utility runs, the Rammax RX1575 trench compactor with infrared remote is faster and easier.

### What size generator do I need for a job site?
For basic tools and lights, 2.5–4.5 kW is enough. For multiple power tools, go with 6–9.7 kW. For industrial equipment or 3-phase needs, rent the 25 kW towable generator.
