When Mike Torres started his landscaping business in St. George three years ago, he made a rookie mistake. He bought a skid steer.

"I financed $45,000 for a machine I use maybe 200 hours a year," he told us recently. "Do the math on that. I'm paying for a machine that sits in my yard eleven months out of twelve."

That's the thing about equipment ownership that nobody tells you upfront—the true cost isn't the sticker price. It's the maintenance, the storage, the insurance, the depreciation, and the opportunity cost of tying up capital in steel instead of growing your business.

This guide isn't a sales pitch. It's 30 years of watching contractors and homeowners in Southern Utah figure out what works—and what doesn't.

## The Real Math on Owning vs. Renting

Let's be honest about the numbers.

A new Bobcat S450 skid steer runs around $45,000. Add $2,000 per year in maintenance, $1,500 per year in insurance, and you're looking at roughly $12,000 per year in total ownership costs when you factor in depreciation. If you're using that machine 80 hours per year, that's about $150 per hour of actual use.

Renting the same machine costs $250-300 per day. Need it 20 days this year? You're spending $5,000-6,000 total—half the ownership cost—with zero maintenance headaches and no machine depreciating in your yard.

The breakeven point sits somewhere around 100-150 days of use per year. Below that threshold, renting almost always makes more financial sense.

## The Three Traps That Catch First-Time Renters

**The Meter vs. Clock Trap.** When you rent a machine, you're charged for two things: clock time (how long the equipment is out) and meter time (actual operating hours). A day rental typically includes 8 meter hours. Pick up an excavator Monday morning, return it Tuesday morning—that's one day of clock time. But if you ran it for 10 hours, you exceeded the meter limit and you'll pay overage. Always ask about meter limits upfront and track your hours.

**The Fuel Trap.** Return the machine with a full tank. Always. No exceptions. We charge $7 per gallon to refuel equipment that comes back empty. That's not a profit center—it's intentionally high to encourage full returns. A couple gallons might seem like no big deal until you see the receipt.

**The Cleaning Trap.** "Reasonably clean" doesn't mean spotless. It means no caked-on mud or debris. A quick hose-down takes ten minutes and saves you a cleaning fee that nobody wants to pay.

---

## Matching Equipment to Your Project

After three decades of "I think I need a..." conversations, we've learned that most people overthink this.

**Moving dirt, gravel, or mulch?** You probably need a skid steer. The S450 handles 90% of residential and light commercial work. Moving material across soft ground or slopes? Consider a track loader instead—the flotation makes a real difference on Southern Utah terrain.

**Digging trenches or holes?** Mini excavators answer 95% of these questions. The E35 is our most popular because it balances size, power, and maneuverability perfectly. Zero tail swing means you can rotate fully without hitting fences or buildings—essential for residential work.

**Concrete work?** This is where specifics matter. Mixing on-site, transporting across a jobsite, finishing a slab, cutting joints—each phase has specific equipment. Call us and describe exactly what you're doing. We'll match you to the right tools.

**Landscaping prep?** Tillers, aerators, dethatchers—these are straightforward. The main question is usually front-tine vs. rear-tine (rear-tine for hard, compacted soil) and how big an area you're covering.

---

## What Southern Utah Does to Equipment

Equipment that works great in mild climates can struggle here. Our soil is rocky and compact. Summer temperatures hit 110°. The terrain ranges from sandy washes to red rock.

Track loaders consistently outperform wheeled skid steers on our terrain—the flotation on loose soil and gravel makes a measurable difference in productivity.

Dust protection matters more than people realize. Check air filters on multi-day rentals. Our fine red dust infiltrates everything.

Hydraulic systems run hot in our summers. Don't push equipment hard during mid-afternoon in July and August. Give machines periodic breaks, especially when working hard.

---

## When to Call vs. When to Just Show Up

**Call ahead if** you need something specific and want to confirm availability, you're unsure what equipment fits your project, you need delivery, or you're a first-time renter with questions.

**Just show up if** you know exactly what you need, you're picking up something common like a trailer, generator, or hand tools, or you're returning equipment.

We're at 1175 Highland Drive in St. George. Open Monday through Friday 7 AM to 5 PM, Saturday 8 AM to noon.

---

## The Bottom Line

Equipment rental isn't complicated. The confusion comes from not knowing what questions to ask.

Here's our promise: call us, describe your project, and we'll tell you exactly what you need—not the most expensive option, not the newest model, but the right tool for what you're actually trying to accomplish.

  "what-equipment-do-you-need": `
Last month, a homeowner came in asking for "the biggest excavator you have" to dig a trench for a sprinkler line.

We rented him a mini excavator instead. One-third the cost, fit through his backyard gate, finished the job in two hours.

That conversation happens almost daily. People assume bigger is better, or they've seen a YouTube video featuring a specific machine, or they just don't know what options exist.

This guide matches projects to equipment. No fluff, no upselling—just practical answers to "what do I actually need?"

---

## Landscaping and Lawn Projects

**Aeration and dethatching** require walk-behind equipment that's simple and effective. An aerator punches holes so air, water, and nutrients reach roots. A power rake removes thatch buildup. Both can be done in an afternoon. Best timing in Southern Utah is early spring or fall when the soil isn't baked solid.

**Soil prep for new sod or seeding** depends on what you're starting with. Rear-tine rototiller for hard-packed soil, front-tine for beds that are already reasonably loose. If you're removing existing grass first, grab a sod cutter—trying to till through established turf is miserable work.

**Moving materials** is where skid steers earn their reputation. But here's an honest assessment most rental yards won't give you: for jobs under 5 yards of material, a wheelbarrow might actually be faster by the time you factor in pickup, operation learning curve, and return. For 5-20 yards, the Bobcat S450 is the workhorse of residential landscaping. Tight access through a 36-inch gate? Mini skid steer. Soft ground or slopes where you don't want wheel marks? Track loader.

---

## Trenching and Utility Work

**Shallow trenches under 24 inches** for irrigation or low-voltage electrical—a walk-behind trencher handles these efficiently. Faster than you'd expect and dramatically easier than digging by hand.

**Medium depth trenches from 2-4 feet** put you in mini excavator territory. The Bobcat E20 or E26 hits the sweet spot—enough reach for utility work without being overkill. Critical detail: zero tail swing models let you rotate fully without swinging into fences or buildings. Essential for residential work near property lines.

**Deeper than 4 feet** and you're getting into larger equipment and probably permit territory. Call us to discuss specifics before you commit to anything.

**After trenching**, don't skip compaction. A jumping jack compacts backfill in confined trenches. Skip this step and you'll have settling issues that show up months later as sunken lines in your yard or driveway.

---

## Concrete Projects

**Mixing on-site** works for small pours. The Multiquip mixer handles up to 9 cubic feet per batch—fine for a small patio, slow for anything substantial.

**Moving concrete across a jobsite** requires a concrete buggy. The Whiteman carries 16 cubic feet and navigates rough terrain without spilling your pour.

**Finishing** depends on scale. Power trowel at 36 inches for patios and residential slabs, 48-inch for larger commercial pours. Don't forget a concrete vibrator for removing air pockets—it's the difference between strong concrete and concrete that cracks.

**Cutting control joints** requires precision timing. The Husqvarna Soff-Cut handles early-entry cuts. Cut too early and you tear the concrete; too late and you get random cracking instead of controlled joints.

---

## Demolition and Debris

**Breaking concrete** scales with thickness. Sidewalks and small slabs take a 60-pound air jack hammer—manageable size, gets the job done. Driveways, foundations, and thick slabs require the 90-pound hammer. More impact force, more vibration, more tiring. Plan for breaks.

For tile and flooring removal indoors, the Makinex jackhammer trolley is a game-changer. Takes a 35-pound hammer and puts it on wheels at an ergonomic height. Your back will thank you.

**Hauling debris** requires matching trailer capacity to volume. 7K dump trailer for residential debris and yard waste. 10K for larger renovation projects. 14K for commercial demo and heavy materials. Note that 10K and larger require at least a 3/4-ton truck.

---

## Flooring Work

**Hardwood refinishing** starts with an orbital sander for the main floor area—the American Sanders model has dust control that keeps your workspace breathable. You'll also need a hand sander for edges and corners; orbitals don't reach walls. Grit progression matters: start at 36-40 for heavy removal, work through 60, 80, 100, finishing around 120-150.

**Tile removal** at scale uses the Makinex trolley with a chisel attachment. Smaller areas or detail work use a Bosch roto hammer—more control but slower going.

**Tile installation cuts** on the MK-101 Pro24 saw handle up to 24-inch rip cuts, covering most large-format tiles.

---

## Still Not Sure?

Call us. Describe what you're trying to accomplish, mention your space constraints and timeline, tell us your experience level. We'll recommend the right equipment—which sometimes means telling you the smaller, cheaper option is actually better for your situation.

  "first-time-rental-guide": `
Your neighbor just rented a mini excavator and dug a pool in his backyard over a weekend. Now you're thinking: "I could do that for my project."

You probably can. Equipment rental isn't as intimidating as it looks.

But there are things nobody tells first-time renters—the fine print that turns a $200 rental into a $350 bill, the mistakes that waste half your rental period, the questions you should ask but don't know to ask.

This guide fills those gaps.

---

## Before You Show Up

**Know your project in detail.** "Digging a trench" is less helpful than "digging a 50-foot trench, 18 inches deep, for irrigation lines." The more specific you are, the better we can match you to equipment.

**Measure your access points.** Gate widths, ceiling heights for indoor work, ground conditions. A machine that won't fit through your gate is useless regardless of how perfect it is for the job.

**Be honest about time.** If you've never operated equipment before, double your initial estimate. Everything takes longer the first time. That's not a knock on you—it's just reality.

**Ask for recommendations.** Don't guess. Call us and describe your project. We have this conversation dozens of times daily. You'll get a specific recommendation, often with alternatives at different price points.

---

## How the Rental Process Works

**Getting the right equipment** happens one of two ways: you know exactly what you need, or we recommend it based on your project description. Either works.

**The deposit** is required before any equipment leaves. Three options: an open check left as security (only cashed if there's damage or non-return), a credit card hold (temporary authorization released on return), or cash at 2.5x the rental amount (refunded on return). This protects everyone. It's standard practice at any reputable rental yard.

**The rental agreement** covers equipment condition, rental period, charges, and your responsibilities. Read it. Ask questions if anything's unclear. This isn't the moment to rush.

**The walkthrough is critical for first-timers.** Ask for a demonstration before you leave. We'll show you how to start and stop the machine, basic controls, safety features, what warning signs to watch for, and loading procedures if applicable. A 10-minute walkthrough prevents hours of fumbling on-site.

---

## Understanding Rental Periods

This trips up first-timers more than anything else.

**Day rental** means 24 hours of clock time from pickup, with 8 hours of meter time (actual operation). Both count. If the machine is out for 24 hours but you ran it for 10 hours, you exceeded meter time and pay overage.

**Half-day rental** gives you 4 hours of clock time. Good for small jobs you can knock out in a morning.

**Weekend rental** lets you pick up Saturday and return Monday before 8 AM, charged as one day if you stay under 8 meter hours. This is the best deal if your project can happen on a weekend.

**Extended rentals** at weekly or monthly rates have higher meter limits and lower effective daily rates. Ask about pricing if your project spans multiple days.

---

## What Beginners Can Actually Operate

An honest assessment based on watching thousands of first-time renters:

**Easy, no experience needed:** Aerators, dethatchers, front-tine tillers, pressure washers, generators, tile saws, floor buffers. Walk-behind equipment with intuitive controls.

**Moderate, instruction helps:** Rear-tine tillers (more powerful, can pull you forward), concrete mixers (loading technique matters), mini excavators on the smaller end like the E10 or E20 (controls are learnable if you start slow), power trowels (finishing concrete is a skill).

**Advanced, prior experience recommended:** Large skid steers, larger excavators like the E50 or E88, 90-pound jackhammers (physically demanding with significant vibration exposure), walk-behind trenchers on hard ground.

Our recommendation: start with smaller equipment. The Bobcat E10 teaches excavator controls at lower stakes than the E50. You can always step up next time.

---

## The Four Mistakes First-Timers Make

**Renting too big.** The bigger machine isn't always better. A full-size skid steer won't help if it can't fit through your gate or tears up your lawn getting to the work area. Measure access points. Tell us your constraints.

**Underestimating time.** Everything takes longer than you think, especially the first time. If you estimate 3 hours, rent for a half-day. If you think a day, consider the weekend rate.

**Returning dirty or empty.** A muddy machine and empty fuel tank can add $50-100 to your bill. Spend 15 minutes cleaning and fueling before return.

**Not asking questions.** Pride kills efficiency. You're not supposed to magically know how controls work. Ask for the walkthrough. Ask questions during the walkthrough. Call us if you hit problems on-site.

---

## Your Checklist Before Coming In

Make sure you can answer yes to these:

I know specifically what project I'm doing. I have measurements—area size, access widths, depth if digging. I've estimated time realistically and added buffer. I have valid ID. I have a deposit method ready. I have transportation or I'll request delivery. I've set aside time for the walkthrough, not rushing out the door.

---

## The Honest Truth

Equipment rental isn't scary. Thousands of first-time renters come through our doors every year, and most have a smooth experience.

The ones who struggle? Usually they rushed the process, skipped the walkthrough, or didn't ask questions upfront.

Take your time. Ask questions. And if the job seems bigger than expected once you're on-site, call us—we'd rather help you troubleshoot than have you struggle in silence.

## Skid Steers

**Bobcat S450** is our most-rented skid steer. At 49 horsepower with 1,370 pounds of lift capacity and a 54-inch width, it hits the sweet spot between capability and maneuverability. Best for residential landscaping, tight spaces, and material handling where you need power without bulk.

**Bobcat S250** steps up to 75 horsepower with 2,500 pounds of lift capacity and a vertical lift path that reaches 10.5 feet. This is the machine for heavy-duty work requiring maximum lift—commercial construction and larger landscaping projects where the S450 would be working too hard.

**Bobcat S62 and S64** represent the R-Series at 68 horsepower with radial lift. The key advantage: no diesel particulate filter, which means simpler maintenance and fewer things to go wrong on a rental. Tough jobs where you want modern features without DPF hassles.

---

## Track Loaders

**Bobcat T450 and T550** put skid steer capability on tracks. The T450 lifts 1,400 pounds; the T550 reaches 1,800 pounds. Both distribute weight better than wheeled machines, making them ideal for soft ground, slopes, and finished landscapes where wheel marks would be a problem.

**Bobcat T62 and T64** bring R-Series benefits to the track loader format—modern design, no DPF, the same advantages as their wheeled counterparts but with track flotation.

---

## Mini Skid Steers

**Ditch Witch SK800 and SK900** fit through 36-inch gates. Perfect for backyard work where full-size equipment simply can't access the work area. If your project is behind a standard fence gate, these are likely your only power equipment option.

**Toro TX1000** is a tracked mini with excellent traction on slopes. When the terrain is too steep for wheels and too tight for a full track loader.

---

## Mini Excavators

**Bobcat E10** is our smallest excavator with a 10.2-horsepower diesel and retractable undercarriage that narrows to 28 inches. Zero tail swing. Best for ultra-tight spaces—backyards, side yards, indoor work. Fits through standard doorways.

**Bobcat E20** digs to 8.5 feet with 14 feet of reach. Zero tail swing and retractable undercarriage. The go-to for residential utility work near fences and buildings where full rotation without overhang is essential.

**Bobcat E26** adds R-Series features including a blade float function for easier backfilling and grading. Same zero-tail-swing maneuverability with more refined controls.

**Bobcat E35** is our best-selling excavator. Zero tail swing with an in-track swing frame. Reliable, capable, operator-friendly. The default choice for all-purpose trenching and excavation when you need more than the smaller models but don't need heavy equipment.

**Bobcat E42 and E50** are larger machines for bigger jobs. Minimal tail swing with load-sensing hydraulics for better control under varying loads.

**Bobcat E88** is R2-Series with conventional tail swing and 14% higher lift capacity than the E85 it replaced. For heavy construction requiring maximum digging force and lift capacity.

**Cat 308 CR** represents Next Generation technology with hydraulic flow up to 44.2 gallons per minute and Stick Steer joystick steering. For demanding tasks requiring top-tier hydraulic performance and attachment versatility.

---

## Compaction Equipment

**MultiQuip MTX60HD Jumping Jack** delivers 3,060 pounds of impact force—the lighter option for smaller compaction jobs in confined areas.

**MultiQuip MTX70HD Jumping Jack** is our most popular rammer at 3,350 pounds of impact force. Exceptionally well-balanced with the right combination of power and control for most trench compaction work.

**Rammax RX1575 Trench Compactor** is an articulating roller with infrared remote control and a 20-horsepower Yanmar engine. For long utility trenches where jumping jacks would take forever.

**Vibratory Roller AR14H** handles larger area compaction—parking lots, road bases, anywhere you need to cover ground efficiently.

---

## Concrete Equipment

**Multiquip MC94S Mixer** holds 9 cubic feet, available in gas or electric. **Whiteman WM90PLF** is the same capacity with a polyethylene drum for easier cleanup.

**Whiteman WBH-16F Buggy** carries 16 cubic feet with a Honda GX390 engine—the standard concrete buggy for moving material across jobsites. **Ultra Buggy 2500-TS** adds tracks, 2,500-pound capacity, and 180-degree swivel dump for rough terrain and precision placement.

**36-inch Multiquip Power Trowel** runs a 4.8-horsepower Honda with QuickPitch handle—residential and mid-sized slabs. **48-inch Multiquip Power Trowel** steps up to 13 horsepower with variable speed for large pours and commercial floors.

**Husqvarna K 770** cuts with a 14-inch blade to 5-inch depth—all-purpose concrete and masonry cutting. **Husqvarna K 4000** handles 16-inch blade cuts from one side, ideal for indoor work and flush cuts. **CX-3 Walk-Behind** manages small to mid-size jobs with wet or dry cutting. **Husqvarna Soff-Cut 150** is specifically for early-entry control joints with a 6-inch blade.

**EDCO Dual-Disc Grinder** for surface prep and coating removal. **Single-Disc Grinder** for detail work and edges.

---

## Air Equipment and Pneumatic Tools

**AIRMAN 185** is a tow-behind compressor at 185 CFM—powers pneumatic tools at the jobsite. **Sullair 375** is the larger option for bigger air demands.

Pneumatic tools include 60-pound and 90-pound air jackhammers, 20-pound chipping hammer for detail work, and various nail guns.

---

## Generators and Welders

Portable generators range from 2.5 kW (lights and small tools) through 4.5 kW (power tools at jobsites), 6 kW (multiple tools simultaneously), to 9.7 kW (larger equipment and backup power).

**25 kW Towable Generator** provides three-phase power for heavy industrial needs at large jobsites with multiple systems running.

**Miller 250 Amp Welder** handles standard jobsite welding. **Miller 400 Amp Welder** for heavy-duty applications.

---

## Trailers

**7K Dump Trailer** at 7,000-pound GVWR with approximately 4,500 pounds of payload. Works with most half-ton trucks for residential debris and hauling.

**10K Dump Trailer** at 10,000-pound GVWR with approximately 6,500 pounds payload. Requires at least a 3/4-ton truck. No out-of-state use.

**14K Dump Trailer** at 14,000-pound GVWR with approximately 10,000 pounds payload. Requires at least a 3/4-ton truck. No out-of-state use.

Various flatbed and utility trailers for equipment transport.
