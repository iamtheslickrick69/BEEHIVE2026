## What Sets BeeHive Apart

### Local Ownership, Local Knowledge

BeeHive isn't a national chain reading from a script. The team knows Southern Utah—the rocky terrain, the heat, the specific challenges contractors face here.

When you describe your project, they'll recommend equipment that actually works for local conditions.

### The Largest Selection in the Region

From Bobcat skid steers to Husqvarna concrete saws, from dump trailers to air compressors—if you need it, BeeHive probably has it.

That means **one stop, one relationship, one phone number to call.**

### On-Site Mechanics

Equipment breaks. It happens. BeeHive has mechanics on-site who service what they rent.

No waiting for a tech to drive in from Las Vegas or Salt Lake. This translates to **less downtime for you.**

## How Rental Pricing Works

Understanding BeeHive's pricing structure helps you budget accurately and avoid surprises.

### Rental Periods

| Period | Duration | Meter Limit |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Half-Day** | 4 hours | Varies by equipment |
| **Full-Day** | 24 hours | 8 hours of use |
| **Weekend** | Saturday pickup, Monday return before 8 AM | 8 hours |
| **Weekly** | 7 days | 40 hours |
| **Monthly** | 28 days | 160 hours |

### The Meter vs. Clock Distinction

**This trips up first-timers:** you're charged for both clock time AND meter time.

- **Clock time** = how long the equipment is out (from pickup to return)
- **Meter time** = actual operating hours

If you rent for 24 hours (clock) but run the equipment for 10 hours (meter), you'll pay for additional meter time beyond the 8-hour daily limit.

### Fuel Policy

Return equipment with a **full tank of fuel**. If you don't, BeeHive charges **$7 per gallon** to refuel.

This is higher than pump prices—it's meant to encourage full returns, not to profit from fuel.

### Deposit Options

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| **Open Check** | Left as security; only cashed if there's damage or non-return |
| **Credit Card Hold** | Temporary authorization; released upon return |
| **Cash** | 2.5x the rental amount; refunded on return |

## Pro Tips from BeeHive's Team

After 30 years, BeeHive's staff has seen every mistake and learned what works. Here's their advice:

### Before You Rent

**1. Measure your access points.** Gates, doorways, driveways—know the dimensions before you reserve equipment.

**2. Describe your project in detail.** "I need a skid steer" is less helpful than "I need to move 20 yards of gravel in a backyard with a 36-inch gate."

**3. Ask about attachments.** The base machine is only part of the equation. Buckets, forks, augers—these can make or break your productivity.

### During Your Rental

**1. Check fluids on multi-day rentals.** Oil, hydraulic fluid, coolant—a quick check prevents major problems.

**2. Don't push beyond your skill level.** If you're new to an excavator, work slowly. Damage from inexperience is still damage.

**3. Call if something seems wrong.** Strange noises, warning lights, performance issues—call BeeHive immediately. Early calls prevent bigger problems.

### At Return

**1. Refuel first.** Every time. No exceptions.

**2. Clean off excessive dirt.** You don't need to detail it, but caked-on mud creates cleaning charges.

**3. Return on time.** The rental period runs until an employee checks the equipment back in—not when you drop it off.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What if I need equipment after hours or on Sunday?

BeeHive is closed Sundays, but you can pick up Saturday and return Monday (weekend rate). For after-hours needs, call ahead to arrange.

### Can I extend my rental if the job runs long?

Yes—call before your rental period ends. Extending is simple; just keeping equipment without calling creates billing complications.

### What happens if something breaks?

If it's a defect or mechanical failure (not caused by misuse), call BeeHive immediately. They have on-site mechanics and can often resolve issues quickly.

If damage is due to misuse, you're responsible—that's what the deposit covers.

### Do I need insurance?

Your homeowner's or contractor's insurance may cover rental equipment. Check with your provider. BeeHive can discuss coverage options.

### Can I rent if I've never used this equipment before?

Absolutely. Many of BeeHive's customers are first-timers. Staff will walk you through operation before you leave.

## New to Equipment Rental? You're in the Right Place.

Renting professional equipment for the first time can feel intimidating. Big machines, unfamiliar terms, deposits, contracts—it's a lot if you've never done it before.

Here's the truth: **it's easier than you think.**

At BeeHive Rental & Sales, we've been helping first-time renters in Southern Utah since 1994.

Homeowners tackling their first landscaping project. DIYers pouring their first concrete slab. Property owners clearing land for the first time.

This guide walks you through everything—what to expect, how rentals work, and how to choose the right equipment for your project.

> *"Beehive is your one stop shop for all things equipment rentals. The staff is friendly and they have the most up to date equipment with the best prices in town! I highly recommend them for your next project!"*
>
> — **Taylor Frazier, Turf It Landscaping**

---

## How Equipment Rental Works (Step by Step)

### Step 1: Know Your Project

Before you call or visit, have a clear idea of what you're trying to accomplish:

- **What are you doing?** (Digging a trench, tilling a garden, breaking concrete, etc.)
- **How big is the area?** (Square footage, depth, length)
- **What's the terrain like?** (Flat yard, rocky soil, tight space near a fence)
- **How long will it take?** (A few hours, a full day, a weekend)

Don't worry if you're unsure about the equipment—that's what BeeHive's staff is for. But knowing your project helps them recommend the right machine.

### Step 2: Get a Recommendation

Call BeeHive at **435-628-6663** or stop by **1175 Highland Drive in St. George**.

Tell them what you're working on. They'll recommend:

- The right equipment for the job
- The size/model that fits your space and skill level
- Any accessories or attachments you might need
- Estimated rental duration

**💡 Pro Tip:** If you're unsure, ask if you can see the equipment before committing. BeeHive's staff will walk you through how it works.

### Step 3: Provide a Deposit

A deposit is required before any equipment leaves the yard. You have three options:

| Deposit Option | How It Works |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Open Check** | Leave a check that's only cashed if there's damage or non-return |
| **Credit Card Hold** | Authorize a temporary hold on your card |
| **Cash Deposit** | Pay 2.5x the rental amount upfront (refunded on return) |

This protects both you and BeeHive. It's standard practice at any reputable rental yard.

### Step 4: Sign the Rental Contract

Before loading equipment, you'll sign a rental agreement covering:

- Equipment condition at pickup
- Rental duration and charges
- Your responsibilities (fuel, cleaning, safe operation)
- Return expectations

Read it. It's straightforward, and the staff will answer any questions.

### Step 5: Get a Quick Tutorial

First time using a skid steer? Never operated a power trowel? **Ask for a walkthrough.**

BeeHive's team will show you:

- How to start and stop the machine
- Basic controls and safety features
- What to watch out for
- How to load/unload from a trailer (if applicable)

Don't be shy—this is normal. Even experienced contractors ask questions about unfamiliar equipment.

### Step 6: Use the Equipment

Take it to your job site and get to work. A few things to keep in mind:

- **Track your time.** Rental charges are based on when equipment leaves and returns—not just when you're using it.
- **Don't push beyond your skill level.** If something feels wrong, stop and call BeeHive.
- **Check fluid levels** on longer rentals (oil, hydraulic fluid, coolant).

### Step 7: Return It Clean and Fueled

When you're done:

- **Return with a full tank of fuel** (or pay $7/gallon)
- **Clean off excessive dirt and mud** (or pay a cleaning fee)
- **Return on time** to avoid additional charges

The rental contract stays open until an employee confirms the return and checks the equipment. Make sure you close out properly.

---

## Understanding Rental Periods and Charges

This is where first-timers often get confused. Here's how it actually works:

### Half-Day Rental

- **Duration:** 4 hours from when equipment leaves the yard
- **Meter limit:** Varies by equipment
- **If you go over:** Additional charges apply

### Full-Day Rental

- **Duration:** 24 hours
- **Meter limit:** 8 hours of actual use
- **If you exceed 8 hours on the meter:** Additional charges apply

### Weekend Rental

- **Pick up:** Saturday
- **Return:** Monday before 8:00 AM
- **Charge:** 1 day (if 8 hours or less on meter)

### Key Point: Time vs. Use

**Rental time** = clock time (when it leaves to when it returns)

**Meter time** = actual operating hours

You're charged for both. A machine sitting overnight still counts toward your 24-hour rental period, even if the meter doesn't move.

**Example:** You rent a mini excavator Saturday morning at 8 AM. You dig for 3 hours, then stop for the day. Sunday you dig for another 4 hours. You return it Monday at 7:30 AM.

- Clock time: Saturday 8 AM to Monday 7:30 AM (weekend rate = 1 day)
- Meter time: 7 hours (under the 8-hour limit)
- **You pay for 1 day.** ✓

## What Equipment Can Beginners Actually Use?

Some equipment is beginner-friendly. Some requires experience. Here's an honest breakdown:

### Beginner-Friendly (Little to No Experience Needed)

| Equipment | Difficulty | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Aerator** | Easy | Walk-behind, intuitive operation |
| **Dethatcher / Power Rake** | Easy | Similar to a lawn mower |
| **Rototiller (front-tine)** | Easy | Good for small garden beds |
| **Pressure Washer** | Easy | Point and spray |
| **Generator** | Easy | Start it, plug in, done |
| **Floor Sander (orbital)** | Easy-Medium | Takes practice for even results |
| **Tile Saw** | Easy-Medium | Slow and steady wins |

### Intermediate (Some Practice or Instruction Recommended)

| Equipment | Difficulty | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Rototiller (rear-tine)** | Medium | More powerful, can pull you forward |
| **Concrete Mixer** | Medium | Loading/unloading takes technique |
| **Power Trowel** | Medium | Finishing concrete is a skill |
| **Mini Excavator (E10, E20)** | Medium | Controls are learnable; start slow |
| **Skid Steer (small)** | Medium-Hard | Dual joystick control takes practice |

### Advanced (Prior Experience Strongly Recommended)

| Equipment | Difficulty | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Large Excavator (E50, E88, Cat 308)** | Hard | Significant machine, real consequences |
| **Skid Steer (large, S250)** | Hard | 2,500 lb lift capacity—know what you're doing |
| **Concrete Saw (walk-behind)** | Hard | Blade control and depth matter |
| **Jack Hammer (90 lb)** | Hard | Physically demanding, vibration exposure |

**⭐ BeeHive's Advice:** If you're unsure, start with the smaller version. A Bobcat E10 teaches you excavator controls without the stakes of an E50. You can always upgrade next time.

## Common First-Timer Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Renting Too Big

**The Problem:** You rent a full-size skid steer for a backyard job and can't maneuver it through the gate.

**The Fix:** Measure your access points. Tell BeeHive your space constraints. They'll recommend equipment that fits.

### Mistake #2: Underestimating Time

**The Problem:** You rent for a half-day, but the job takes 6 hours. Now you're paying for a full day anyway.

**The Fix:** Add buffer time. If you think it'll take 3 hours, rent for 4. If you think a full day, consider overnight.

### Mistake #3: Returning It Dirty

**The Problem:** You return a mud-caked excavator and get charged a $75 cleaning fee.

**The Fix:** Hose it down before returning. "Reasonably clean" means no caked-on dirt or debris.

### Mistake #4: Forgetting to Refuel

**The Problem:** You return the generator with a quarter tank and get charged $7/gallon to fill it.

**The Fix:** Fill up on the way back. It takes 5 minutes and saves real money.

### Mistake #5: Not Asking Questions

**The Problem:** You're embarrassed to ask how the controls work, so you figure it out on-site and waste 2 hours.

**The Fix:** Ask at pickup. BeeHive's staff does walkthroughs all day. It's literally their job.

No. Many of BeeHive's customers are first-time renters. Staff will recommend beginner-friendly equipment and show you how to operate it before you leave.
